<h1>I.arc 212 Visual Communications II - General Information</h1>

<p>Visual Communications II will again be team-taught by Michael Barrett and Rob Ventura. The semester will be divided in half, into two sections. The first section taught exclusively by Rob, the second section taught exclusively by Michael. This differs from the previous semester, where we alternated teaching Tuesdays and Thursdays. </p>

<p>Each half or section of the semester will have its own curriculum with its own material and coursework. Rob's section will focus on 3D modeling and rendering using digital and manual techniques. Michael's section will focus on graphic design skills, software skills, and production of print and web pieces.</p>

<h2>Why The Change?</h2>

<p>This split semester format is a new approach. We believe that by focusing on similar concepts for an extended period, instead of jumping in between concepts every Tuesday and Thursday, will make for easier understanding of material. Also by covering 3D techniques exclusively in the first section you will be able to apply them in your studio projects later in the semester.</p>

<h2>Meeting Times:</h2>

<p>Visual Communications meets Tuesday and Thursday of each week:</p>
<ul>
<li>IARC 212-01 TR 9.00 - 10.20</li>
<li>IARC 212-02 TR 10.30 - 11.50</li>
</ul>

<p>Regardless of the instructor listed in the course schedule, each section is taught and graded by both Michael Barrett and Rob Ventura.</p>


<h2>Contact:</h2>

<p>If you need to speak with one of us please schedule a time before or after class or during posted office hours. Outside of class time, we prefer to be contacted by email. Email provides a record with a time and date, helping us keep track of any issues that may arise.</p>

<ul>
<li>Michael Barrett: <a href="mailto:mwbarret@uncg.edu">mwbarret@uncg.edu</a></li>
<li>Rob Ventura: <a href="mailto:rlventur@uncg.edu">rlventur@uncg.edu</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Attendance:</h2>

<p>Attending class is mandatory <em>and</em> necessary. Digital media is complex and requires attention and repetition to learn. In order to adequately understand the material, it is necessary to be in class.</p>

<p>Attendance will be taken at the beginning of class. Late students may be considered absent.</p>

<p>More than 3 absences will reduce your final grade by one half a letter grade (e.g. an "A" student with 4 absences will receive a "B+").</p>

<p>If you must be out of class, you must notify us in advance, or immediately afterwards in writing or email. Absences may be excused with proper notification at the discretion of the instructors. No make-up work will be allowed without proper notification (advance warning, doctor's note, etc.).</p>

<h2>Grading:</h2>

<p>Assignments will be given a letter grade (e.g. B, B+, B-). Michael and Rob's sections will be graded separately then the section grade averaged for the semester grade.  Students must pass both sections of I.arc 212 in order to pass the class.</p>



<h1>I.arc 212 Visual Communications II - Rob's Section</h1>
 
<p>We will explore three-dimensional modeling with Form-Z; however, we will not forsake our traditional means of representation.  The class will focus on developing basic comfort with Form-Z terminology, modeling, and rendering, while comparing it to design aids more familiar to us.</p>

<p>The web site for this section of I.arc 212 is:<br>
<a href="http://www.uncg.edu/~rlventur/212formz/index.html">http://www.uncg.edu/~rlventur/212formz/index.html</a>


<h1>I.arc 212 Visual Communications II - Michael's Section</h1>

<h2>Graphic Design & Software Skills - Print & Web Delivery</h2>

<p>Coursework for this section will be focused in two main areas:</p>

<ol>
<li>Further development of Graphic Design Skills and software skills.</li>
<li>Production of graphic designs in print and web format.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Focus 1:  Graphic Design & Software Skills</h3>

<p>We will begin the section with a few warm-up/refresher exercises to re-familiarize you with Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator. These exercises will strengthen skills learned last semester, and introduce new techniques.</p>

<p>Following the warm-up/refresher exercises, we will look more closely at the following concepts:</p>

<ul>
<li>Basic Design Principles</li>
<li>Typefaces (Fonts) & Designing with Type</li>
<li>Layout (Arranging words, pictures, and other elements on a page or presentation board)</li>
</ul>

<p>Each concept will be accompanied by a short in-class demo-assignment and a larger assignment to be completed during and outside of class.  Both will be turned in for a grade.</p>

<h3>Focus 2: Print & Web Delivery</h3>

<p>This portion of the class will focus on creating graphically well-designed projects and "delivering" them in print or as a web page.</p>

<p>There will be three projects:</p>

<ul>
<li>Presentation Board (correlated to a studio project)</li>
<li>Printable Portfolio</li>
<li>Portfolio Website</li>
</ul>

<p>Each project will be graded in stages. For example, a grade will be given for each phase of developing a presentation board, Preliminaries, First Draft, Revision, and the Final Print.</p>

<h3>Semester Goals:</h3>

<p>By the end of the semester you should:</p>

<ol>
<li>Feel more confident with graphic design software.</li>
<li>Demonstrate improved design and software skills.</li>
<li>Have a print and web portfolio suitable for pursuing grants, scholarships, internships, or employment.</li>
<li>Have a better understanding of how web pages and web sites work.</li>
</ol>
