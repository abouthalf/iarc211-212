<h1>Why Does What Suck?</h1>

<h2>Kind of Snobby Isn't it?</h2>

<p>Well what's the point of higher education unless you can flaunt it?</p>

<p>&quot;Why Does This Suck?&quot; is a catchy title designed to provoke some close looking and strong critique of real, living, breathing design.</p>

<p>The idea isn't just to rant about how bad something sucks, it's to really think about the pros and cons, the successes and failures, the assumed goals and how close they came to meeting them.</p>

<p>Each response to the weekly WTDS should be between 250 and 500 words. Yes, I will count them. Each response will be evaluated for clarity and strength of comments.</p>

          MICHAEL'S PAGE:  this is soooo late, but michael's web-page is great.  it's a great tool for class and it's organization is very well thought out.  i, for one, like the simplicity of the color.  it's something besides white, but it doesn't distract.  i did find myself having to print out a few things from the website just to make referencing them easier - not nearly as much paper wasted as would have been had everything been hand-outs.  thanks for the clarity and for making information for the class so easily accessed.  </p>

          everyone's hard work really shows in the illustrator challenge, and so it is hard to choose one. but since we must, i vote for sarah norville's because she spent so many hours on that thing and there is just  so much detail! excellent job sarah!!!</p>
