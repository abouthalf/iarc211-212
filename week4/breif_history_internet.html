<h1>A (Very) Brief History of The Internet</h1>
<h2> What's an "Internet" Anyhow?</h2>
<p>The Internet is a worldwide network of computer networks. A "<a href="http://whatis.techtarget.com/WhatIs_Definition_Page/0,4152,212644,00.html">Network</a>" 
is two or more <a href="http://whatis.techtarget.com/WhatIs_Definition_Page/0,4152,212665,00.html">computers 
(called "nodes" on a network)</a> connected together in order to share 
information and resources. The internet is a very special type of network for 
two reasons:</p>
<p>1. Its size. The Internet connects 9.5 million <a href="http://whatis.techtarget.com/WhatIs_Definition_Page/0,4152,212254,00.html">hosts</a> 
or computers as of 1996 (<a href="http://www.mit.edu/people/mkgray/net/internet-growth-summary.html">source</a>)</p>
<p>2. It is standardized. All computers, Mac, PC, UNIX, Palm Pilot, or any thing 
else uses the same languages (<a href="http://whatis.techtarget.com/WhatIs_Definition_Page/0,4152,212839,00.html">protocols</a>) 
and tools (<a href="http://whatis.techtarget.com/WhatIs_Definition_Page/0,4152,214173,00.html">TCP/IP</a>) 
to connect and communicate over the Internet</p>
<p>So, with any old computer you scrounge up, you could connect to the millions 
of other computers on the Internet, because they all speak the same language.</p>
<h2>So Who Started it?</h2>
<p>Surprise, it was the government. In 1969 an agency of the United States Department 
of Defense, known as the <b>Advanced Research Projects Agency</b>, began research 
on robust nationwide information networks that could withstand wars or natural 
disasters. This network was called <a href="http://whatis.techtarget.com/WhatIs_Definition_Page/0,4152,213782,00.html">ARPANET</a> 
(Advanced Research Projects Agency Network). ARPANET was designed so that it could 
function even if several sites supporting the network were destroyed in war or 
natural disaster. </p>
<p>The ARPANET was eventually divided into the strictly military Milnet, and a 
new ARPANET which connected mainly universities. A new communication language 
was created so that members of both networks could communicate. These protocols 
became known as <a href="http://whatis.techtarget.com/WhatIs_Definition_Page/0,4152,214173,00.html">TCP/IP</a>. 
New networks were created (like the National Science Foundation's NSFNET) which 
also used the TCP/IP protocols. With a common language, networks could then talk 
to other networks, making possible the enormous Internet we know and love today.<br>
(<a href="http://whatis.techtarget.com/WhatIs_Definition_Page/0,4152,213782,00.html">source</a>) 
</p>
<h2>Well, Then What?</h2>
<p>Since mostly universities and research institutions were using these networks, 
they got into the habit making their information, documents, and software available 
to all for free. This spirit of open information exchange still exists on the 
Internet in the form of free content (you have to pay for a newspaper) and lots 
of free software (Netscape and Internet Explorer are both free, if you want to 
take the time to download them). This wealth of free information and software 
attracted more people. As personal computers became cheaper and more powerful, 
and also became equipped with high speed modems, more individuals could access 
the Internet with a computer and regular telephone lines. As demand for these 
services increased, businesses, institutions, and individuals pressured the U.S. 
government funded Internet to open its doors to unrestricted traffic. Which they 
did in the early 1990s.</p>
<p>The content of the Internet at this point was mostly plain text information 
about academic subjects. No pictures, no music, no <a href="http://www.joecartoon.com/">cartoons</a>. 
Aside from being boring, it was also very difficult to use and very disorganized. 
Not many 'normal' people had the knowledge or interest to dig through countless 
boring text files to find some boring academic paper.</p>
<h2>HTML. Fun For Everybody.</h2>
<p>Around the same time the Internet opened for business, physicists at CERN (the 
European Particle Physics Laboratory) created and released an authoring language 
and distribution system called Hypertext Markup Language or HTML. HTML could integrate 
text, pictures, and multimedia right inside one document. HTML also included linking, 
so one document could be connected to another document anywhere. </p>
<p>Then when students and faculty at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications 
at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign (NCSA, the fine people who brought 
you "Telnet") invented an easy to use web browser called "Mosaic" 
and gave it away for free, millions started surfing the web for cool stuff.<br>
(Source: <u>HTML &amp; XHTML. The Definitive Guide</u>. <i>Chuck Musicano, 
Bill Kennedy</i>. <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/">O'Reilly &amp; Associates</a>, 
Inc. Sebastopol, CA 95472)</p>
<p>Those bright lads who came up Mosaic went on to create the Netscape company 
and web browser and make a gajillion dollars. America Online followed soon after. 
With hundreds of Internet Service Providers (<a href="http://whatis.techtarget.com/WhatIs_Definition_Page/0,4152,214028,00.html">ISP</a>s) 
cropping up all the time, and lots of media and business interest, the Internet 
blew up big in the mid 1990s. </p>
