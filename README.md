# Teaching web site for Interior Architecture 211 - 212

In 2001 - 2002 I taught my third section of Interior Architecture Visual Communication 211 - 212.

In this course we practiced drawing, typography, Photoshop, Illustrator, and little bit of web design.

It’s a time capsule from the early days.

## About

This site was assembled by hand using BBEdit and Photoshop 6 for graphics on a Bondi Blue iMac. I used up-to-date techniques like CSS based layout and alternating pixel transparent GIFs to create transparent layers.
