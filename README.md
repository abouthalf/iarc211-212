# Teaching web site for Interior Architecture 211 - 212

In 2001 - 2002 I taught my third section of Interior Architecture Visual Communication 211 - 212.

In this course we practiced drawing, typography, Photoshop, Illustrator, and little bit of web design.

Itâ€™s a time capsule from the early days.
